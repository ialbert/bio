"""
This module combines kallisto and salmon abundance files scattered across directories.

The output of the program is similar to the count file produced by featureCounts

Usage:
    
     bio combine DIRS
    
Where:

 - DIRS are directories containing

For each id the IDS file the program will attempt to load the file named as 

   DIR/abundances.tsv or DIR/quant.sf files.

Once all files are loaded these are combined into a result that has six columns to start each row, 
then the estimated abundance from each file labeled with a sample name.
