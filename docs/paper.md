# Summary

Biological data is cdistributed from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. Life sciences in general are characterized distirbuted oversight where various databases and resources are maintained by different organizations. The same data may be represented under disparate names and may be stored in different formats.

As an example gene with a common name of ??? may be represented as ...


# Statement of need

Anyone that has ever done bioinformatics knows well how even seemingly straightforward tasks typically require multiple convoluted steps, scouring the various corners of the internet, reading documentation, clicking around various websites that all together can slow down progress immensely.  What could be a five minute task turns into hours or days of work.

The cause of all the difficulties is the disconnected nature of data and information, the lack of a common interface, the lack of a unified approach to data access and manipulation.


The `bio` package is meant to solve that tedium. It is a bioinformatics toy to play with. Like LEGO pieces that match one another `bio` aims to provide users with commands that naturally fit together and let users express their intent with short, explicit and simple commands. 

The `bio` package is a Python package that aims to simplify the access and manipulation of biological data. The package provides a set of commands that can be used to fetch, manipulate, and analyze biological data. The package is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing users to perform a wide range of tasks with minimal effort. The package is designed to be used by students, educators, and researchers in the field of bioinformatics. The package is open-source and freely available for download from the [GitHub repository][bio-src]. Detailed documentation is available at [bioinfo.help][bio-docs].
